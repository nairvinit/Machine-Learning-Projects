# my-mL-journey
Home projects for the machine learning enthusiast in me. 

I made these projects between June 2018 and September 2018.

All these projects have been uploaded directly to Github and were coded in Spyder 3.0 using the Anaconda framework.

The datasets were obtained online from superdatascience.com
